# Data Science for the Biomedical Sciences

This is the repository for the [`ds4biomed`](https://ds4biomed.tech/) materials.

## Download files and data

You can download the files and data to follow along the materials by clicking the green "Code" button on the top.
Then you can click "Download ZIP" to download the files.

## Binder cloud environment

If you cannot get R + Rstudio installed on your computer to follow along with the lesson materials.
We have provided a binder instance that has everything set up for you.
The downside is that it will take a *very* long time to spin up and you will need to manually export any files you create.

Please see the binder section in the lesson materials for more information about useage and setup: https://ds4biomed.tech/setup.html#binder

- Complete RStudio environment: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chendaniely/ds4biomed/learner?urlpath=rstudio)<- click that
- Semi-complete RStudio environment: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/r/master?urlpath=rstudio)
  - This environment may load faster, but you need to do some additional set up.
  - Please follow these instructions to finish the setup:
